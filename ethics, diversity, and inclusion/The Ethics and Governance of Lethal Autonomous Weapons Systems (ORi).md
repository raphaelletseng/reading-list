Lethal Auto weapons systems (LAWS) : weapons systems in which the system makes the decision to use lethal force without requiring human intervention [Doesn’t seem like it’s currently in use, just under development]
vs.
Remotely Operated Weapons Systems (ROWS): weaponised system where a person in a remote location makes the decision to use lethal force.

Survey Results:
	1. All types of LAWS should be internationally banned (67%)
	2. LAWS shouldn’t be developed or used (56%)
	3. LAWS should not be used for offensive purposes (85%) - [What are non offensive uses of LAWS? - ANS: Defensive but seems like a very blurry line]
	4. They would rather they country use ROWS instead of LAWS when waging war (71%)
	5. They would rather be attacked by ROWS instead of LAWS (60%) - [Are you asking this question to anyone who might be attacked by any kind of weapons system?]

- Conclude: don’t endorse LAWS for war - more international public engagement is necessary to support democratic decisions about what’s appropriate when developing and using robotic weapons tech.

## Intro: Military Drones and the Role of Public Opinion

BIG QUESTIONS:
	• What kind of decisions are we comfortable delegating to machines? What kinds of decisions should remain in human hands?
	• Should robots be allowed to make life and death decisions? Who gets to decide?

LAWS are a matter of democratic and humanitarian concern - for ethical and democratic legitimacy it is crucial to engage the public in the discussion, and to take into account their views on this topic <- [THiS IS WORKING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT U AGREE W DEMOCRACY. IDK sometimes I don’t trust the public..]
- The Martens Clause, included in the additional protocols of the Geneva Conventions: 
“Recalling that, in cases not covered by the law in force, the human person remains under the protection of the principles of humanity and the dictates of the public conscience.” (Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions)

Though legal scholars often disagree on how best to interpret and implement the Martens Clause, it remains a fact that from the perspective of the Clause, the public is called upon to help shape international laws of armed conflict that have yet to be established
